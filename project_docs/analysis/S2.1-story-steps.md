# Story S2.1: Implement Virtual File System Core

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1. Enable Path Resolution System
Must Support:
- Converting between logical and physical file paths
- Handling different path formats (Windows, Unix)
- Resolving relative and absolute paths

Manual Verification:
- Path conversion works correctly
- Different path formats are supported
- Relative and absolute paths resolve accurately

Prerequisite: None

Developer Notes:
- Use Java NIO Path utilities
- Handle cross-platform path differences
- Implement robust error handling for invalid paths

### Step 2. Create Directory Structure Monitoring Service
Must Support:
- Tracking changes in directory structures
- Detecting file and folder additions/deletions
- Providing real-time updates on filesystem changes

Manual Verification:
- Changes in directories are detected
- New files and folders are recognized
- Deleted items are properly tracked

Prerequisite: Path Resolution System

Developer Notes:
- Consider using WatchService from Java NIO
- Implement efficient change detection mechanism
- Minimize performance overhead

### Step 3. Implement Basic Filesystem Traversal
Must Support:
- Listing directory contents
- Navigating through directory hierarchies
- Retrieving file and folder metadata

Manual Verification:
- Directory contents can be listed
- Ability to move between directories
- Metadata for files and folders is accessible

Prerequisite: Path Resolution System

Developer Notes:
- Use Java NIO for filesystem operations
- Implement efficient directory listing
- Handle large directory structures

### Step 4. Configure Root Shared Folder
Must Support:
- Defining root shared folder location
- Validating shared folder accessibility
- Setting initial filesystem configuration

Manual Verification:
- Root shared folder is correctly set
- Folder is accessible and readable
- Configuration can be modified

Prerequisite: Filesystem Traversal

Developer Notes:
- Allow flexible shared folder configuration
- Implement security checks for folder access
- Support multiple shared folder configurations

### Step 5. Create Filesystem Interactions Abstraction Layer
Must Support:
- Providing a unified interface for filesystem operations
- Decoupling filesystem logic from other components
- Supporting future filesystem implementation changes

Manual Verification:
- Filesystem operations work through abstraction layer
- Different filesystem implementations can be swapped
- Core functionality remains consistent

Prerequisite: All previous steps

Developer Notes:
- Design clean, extensible interface
- Use dependency injection for flexibility
- Minimize direct filesystem dependencies in other components
