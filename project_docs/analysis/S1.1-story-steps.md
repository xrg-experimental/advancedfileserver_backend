# Story S1.1 Implementation Steps

## Step 1. Enable Shared Folder Configuration
Must Support:
- Configuration of shared folder paths
- Validation of folder paths
- Storage of configuration settings
Manual Verification:
- Configuration can be loaded from properties
- Invalid configurations are detected and reported
- Changes to configuration are properly saved
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider supporting multiple shared folders
- Include path validation logic
- Support configuration updates at runtime

## Step 2. Enable Package Owner Permission Verification
Must Support:
- Verification of filesystem access rights
- Permission checking on configured folders
- Startup validation process
Manual Verification:
- System verifies permissions on startup
- Access denied is properly reported
- Permission changes are detected
Prerequisite: Step 1
Developer Notes:
- Include detailed permission reporting
- Consider periodic permission re-verification
- Handle permission changes gracefully

## Step 3. Enable Directory Structure Persistence
Must Support:
- Storage of directory hierarchy
- Mapping between virtual and physical paths
- Basic path operations
Manual Verification:
- Directory structure is accurately stored
- Path relationships are maintained
- Structure updates are persisted
Prerequisite: Step 2
Developer Notes:
- Consider scalability for large directories
- Include parent-child relationship tracking
- Support for path normalization

## Step 4. Enable Path Resolution
Must Support:
- Resolution of virtual paths to physical locations
- Handling of relative and absolute paths
- Path validation and normalization
Manual Verification:
- Paths are correctly resolved
- Invalid paths are properly handled
- Relative paths work as expected
Prerequisite: Step 3
Developer Notes:
- Include path security validation
- Support for path traversal prevention
- Handle special path characters

## Step 5. Enable Filesystem Change Detection
Must Support:
- Real-time monitoring of filesystem changes
- Detection of file/directory modifications
- Synchronization with database
Manual Verification:
- Changes are detected in real-time
- Database is updated with changes
- System handles rapid changes properly
Prerequisite: Step 4
Developer Notes:
- Consider change batching for performance
- Include change verification mechanism
- Handle temporary files appropriately
