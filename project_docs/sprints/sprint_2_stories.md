# Sprint 2 Stories

## Story S2.1: Implement Virtual File System Core
As a system developer, I want to complete the core virtual file system implementation to enable fundamental file and directory operations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement path resolution system
- Create service for directory structure monitoring
- Support basic filesystem traversal
- Handle root shared folder configuration
- Provide abstraction layer for filesystem interactions

Dependencies: None

Developer Notes:
- Use Java NIO for filesystem operations
- Implement error handling for filesystem access
- Consider performance for large directory structures

## Story S2.2: Develop Basic File Operations
As a user, I want to perform basic file and directory operations to manage my files effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement file creation functionality
- Support file deletion operations
- Enable directory listing
- Provide basic file content reading
- Handle file operation permissions

Dependencies: 
- Depends on S2.1 (Virtual File System Core)

Developer Notes:
- Integrate with user authentication system
- Implement permission checks
- Use transactional file operations

## Story S2.3: Enhance Group Access Control
As an administrator, I want to implement advanced group-based access control to manage file permissions effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create group-specific storage spaces
- Implement permission inheritance for directories
- Support group-level file operation restrictions
- Enable group membership-based access control
- Provide administrative interfaces for group permissions

Dependencies:
- Depends on existing User Management system
- Builds upon S2.1 and S2.2

Developer Notes:
- Leverage existing group and user management
- Design flexible permission model
- Implement efficient permission checking mechanisms
