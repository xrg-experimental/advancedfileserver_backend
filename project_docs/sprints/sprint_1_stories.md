# Sprint 1 Stories

## Story S1.1: Virtual File System Core Setup
As a developer, I want to implement the core virtual file system structure so that we can directly manage DSM shared folders using the package owner's filesystem permissions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- System directly accesses configured shared folder using package owner's filesystem permissions
- Directory structure is properly represented in database
- Basic path resolution functionality works
- Shared folder configuration is manageable through properties
- System handles invalid folder configurations gracefully
- Directory structure changes are detected through direct filesystem monitoring
- Package owner filesystem permissions are verified on startup

Dependencies: None

Developer Notes:
- Use SynologyProperties for shared folder configuration
- Implement using JPA entities for virtual file system nodes
- Consider caching strategy for path resolution
- Use Java NIO for direct filesystem operations
- Implement filesystem change detection using WatchService
- Ensure all operations respect package owner's filesystem permissions

## Story S1.2: Basic File Operations Implementation
As a user, I want to perform basic file operations so that I can manage files in the system.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create new files in any directory
- Read existing file content
- Update file content
- Delete existing files
- List files in directories
- System maintains consistency with actual filesystem
- Operations respect available storage space
- Handle concurrent file operations appropriately

Dependencies: S1.1

Developer Notes:
- Implement using Java NIO for direct filesystem operations
- Consider chunked file handling for large files
- Use transaction management for database operations
- Implement proper error handling for filesystem operations
- Ensure proper file locking mechanisms for concurrent access

## Story S1.3: File Metadata Management
As a system administrator, I want the system to maintain file metadata so that files can be properly tracked and managed.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Store essential file metadata (size, creation date, modification date, mime type)
- Update metadata automatically when files change
- Maintain metadata consistency with actual files
- Support custom metadata fields
- Properly handle metadata for moved/renamed files
- Clean up metadata when files are deleted

Dependencies: S1.1, S1.2

Developer Notes:
- Design flexible metadata schema in PostgreSQL
- Consider using JPA entity listeners for automatic updates
- Implement background job for metadata consistency checks
- Use proper indexing for frequent metadata queries
