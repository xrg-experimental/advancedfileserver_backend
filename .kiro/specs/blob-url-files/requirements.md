# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a blob URL system for handling file downloads in the REST API using filesystem hard links. Instead of directly streaming files through the API endpoint, the system will create hard links to existing files and provide secure temporary download URLs. This approach works consistently for files of any size, provides instant link creation, and separates file access from download delivery, enabling better progress tracking, improved user experience, and reduced server load during file transfers. The system must support both Linux (production) and Windows (development/testing) environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to request any file through the API and receive a temporary download URL instantly, so that I can download the file with proper progress tracking and without blocking the API connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests any file THEN the system SHALL create a hard link and return a temporary download URL immediately (sub-second response)
2. WHEN the hard link is created THEN the system SHALL provide a JSON response containing the download URL, file metadata, and expiration time
3. IF the hard link creation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response with details about the failure
4. WHEN a client receives the download URL THEN the system SHALL allow standard HTTP download with range requests for progress tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want temporary hard links to be automatically cleaned up after expiration, so that the filesystem doesn't accumulate unused hard links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a temporary download URL is created THEN the system SHALL set a configurable expiration time (default 1 hour)
2. WHEN the expiration time is reached THEN the system SHALL automatically delete the hard link (not the original file)
3. WHEN a client attempts to access an expired URL THEN the system SHALL return a 404 or 410 status code
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL clean up any expired hard links from previous sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to download files using the temporary URL with full HTTP features, so that I can implement proper download progress, resume capabilities, and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading from a temporary URL THEN the system SHALL support HTTP range requests for partial content
2. WHEN a download is interrupted THEN the client SHALL be able to resume using range requests
3. WHEN accessing the download URL THEN the system SHALL provide proper Content-Length, Content-Type, and Content-Disposition headers
4. WHEN multiple clients access the same URL THEN the system SHALL serve the file concurrently without conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want temporary URLs to be secure and not easily guessable, so that unauthorized users cannot access files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a temporary URL THEN the system SHALL use a cryptographically secure random token
2. WHEN a temporary URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate the token before serving the file
3. IF an invalid or malformed token is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code
4. WHEN a temporary URL expires THEN the system SHALL invalidate the token permanently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want clear status information about download URLs, so that I can provide appropriate feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a download URL is created THEN the system SHALL provide a status endpoint to check URL validity and expiration
2. WHEN querying URL status THEN the system SHALL return current state (active, expired, invalid)
3. WHEN checking an active URL THEN the system SHALL provide file metadata and remaining time until expiration
4. WHEN a URL expires THEN the status endpoint SHALL return expired status with appropriate cleanup confirmation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system that operates on filesystems with hard link support, I want the hard link functionality to work reliably within a single filesystem, so that temporary download URLs can be created efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify that the configured temporary directory supports hard links
2. WHEN creating a temporary download URL THEN the system SHALL create a hard link within the same filesystem as the original file
3. IF the original file and temporary directory are on different filesystems THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the limitation
4. WHEN hard link creation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response without attempting fallback mechanisms
