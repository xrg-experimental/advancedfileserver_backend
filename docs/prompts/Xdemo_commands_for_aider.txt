/architect For a demo of the implementation I need a database with demo data. 
Please create an SQL script to fill a database with demo data. You find all
implemented rest endpoints in file api-docs.json. And I need a short description
how to use the demo. Write the description to file docs/demo.md.

error while testing -> more log data added

/architect The demo database is initialized. The login test 1 from demo.md failed.
I found the reason for the "401 Unauthorized" answer. We try to use 
https://localhost:5001 for authentication in the code. The demo is not running on the real
Synology NAS, but on a local machine. Please create a new file docs/synology-mock.md 
with the specification of a mock-server which can be used for the demo. I want
to use the specification to create a mock-server.

Now asking claude.chat:
For testing my file server project in demo mode I need mock server described in 
the attached document. My project is a Java-Spring-Boot application build with maven. 
Can you present me different approaches for implementing the mock server and give me 
best practice advise for implementation details?
file: docs/synology-mock.md

Second question:
I like the Embedded WireMock approach. Can you collect all relevant information from 
your answer I need and write them in one document, please. This document shall be a 
single source for the implementation.

=> synology-mock-server-implementation.md

We are working on the implementation of the mock server. Use synology-mock-server-implementation.md 
as guideline. Don only the things I am asking for. Start with the Dependencies.

Now the Configuration.
