/read-only ../docs/AdvancedFileServer_User_Stories.md

added only java files without tests, removed some docs

/architect Now to point 9. of the user stories.
What are the next steps to take and which files are involved?
Please make a list of the files. Do not start to write code.

-> too much in a large step

/architect We need a table "user_roles" and a corresponding 
class for the "roles" field in class User. Make a list with 
the next steps to take.

-> test error

File src/main/resources/logback.xml is empty. This lets the
test run fail.

All tests are running now again. Please add tests to AuthControllerTest.java

-> error: "Schema-validation: missing table [user_roles]"

/architect The new tests and the main app now have an error: 
"Schema-validation: missing table [user_roles]"
Show me possible solutions.

-> manually added table user_roles to PostgreSQL
-> less error but 1 test failed

One test failed: loginInvalidRequest()
jakarta.servlet.ServletException: Request processing failed: java.lang.NullPointerException: 
Cannot invoke "org.springframework.security.core.Authentication.getPrincipal()" because "authentication" is null


/add docs/AdvancedFileServer_Implementation_backend.md
/architect Are there any missing implementations or tests for user story 9?
When we are ready then add a section to docs\AdvancedFileServer_Implementation_backend.md.

-> 2 new tests failed

/architect Test whenAdminAccessAnyEndpoint_thenOk() failed in line 44 with the error message
I copied to file logs/whenAdminAccessAnyEndpoint_thenOk.txt
