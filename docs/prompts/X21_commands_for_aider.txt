I made the new tests run. Check if something is missing for unit testing User Story 24.

/architect The design of the AdvancedFileServer has been changed to use Synolgy DSM
only for administration authentication. Update the AdvancedFileServer_User_Stories.md
the reflect these changes. Do not modify the numbering from 1 to 25 because these
numberes have been used as reference before.

/architect Which files would be changed or added to modify the authentication logic
of the AdvancedFileServer. The first login from the frontend uses /api/login for
all users. If the user has OTP activated, then an additional login parameter is
required. The second login from the frontend uses /api/login/otp for all users.
Administrators must have OTP activated. The credentials of an Administrator are
send to the Synolgy DSM for authentication.

Write a documentation of the new authentication logic into the file docs/AdvancedFileServer_authentication.md.
This file shall be used as reference for the frontend developers.

/architect Which files would be changed or added to modify the authentication logic
of the AdvancedFileServer again. The first login from the frontend uses /api/login
all users. If the user has OTP activated, then the response is not longer an
error but the info to redirect to the OTP login page. The second login from the 
frontend uses an additional login parameter for the OTP. Administrators must have 
OTP activated. The credentials of an Administrator are send to the Synolgy DSM for 
authentication.

/architect Which files to you need to see or modify to implement for the following change?
 1 Implement a /system/status endpoint on your backend
 2 Ensure the endpoint returns a JSON object with:
    • status: 'Online' | 'Offline' | 'Degraded'
    • lastChecked: current timestamp

/architect Which files to you need to see or modify to implement for the following change?
The status of the server is checked every 5 seconds. Therefore I want to supress all debug messages for calls to the /system/status endpoint.
